* Here, there are 2 scenarios where voter can vote,

   2. if the name is not there in the list(signup.csv),then to vote he must create a username & password by clicking sign-up option and proceed to vote by signin.
* In my machine a voter can vote to any of the candidate only once,this is encrypted by the 't/f' element in the list(signup.csv).if the voter has used his vote option      then his name is saved in the list as 't',in the opposite case it will be 'f',
* If the user created credentials by using signup option does not use cast-vote option then,it will be considered as duplicate user and his details will not be stored in the list(signup.csv).
* Live count is also shown to the voter from the deatils stored in file-(votecount.csv).
* signup.csv model:

    | Username  | Password  | t/f |
    | :-----------: |:---------------:| :----:|
    | voter 1 name  | voter 1 pass  | t/f |
    | voter 2 name  | voter 2 pass  | t/f |
